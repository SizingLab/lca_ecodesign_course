    "The objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with transporting a package using a battery-powered drone. For this purpose, a reference drone will be assessed, and design alternatives will be evaluated for comparison with the reference. In particular, the sensitivity to the size of the drone and the battery technology will be assessed to explore opportunities for reducing the impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product & Functional Unit**<br>\n",
    "The operation consists of delivering a 2 kg package from point A to point B at a distance of 15 kilometres and a speed of 30 km/h. For this purpose, the drone is required to have a flight endurance of at least 30 minutes. It is assumed that this mission will be carried out 5 times a day (only during working days) for 2 years, i.e. 2500 trips. For better understanding, the functional unit will be reported per unit of package delivered rather than the total number of packages transported.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boundaries**<br>\n",
    "The study encompasses the production of the drone components and their transportation to the final assembly site. Also included is the electricity required to power the drone during the use phase. The components are treated as wastes at the end of their life, such that no recycling is considered. The processes and facilities required for the final assembly of the drone are excluded from the study, as well as the ground infrastructures and the ancillary systems (e.g., battery chargers) that support the flight operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological choices**<br>\n",
    "The impact assessment relies on the EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method v3.1 which covers 16 environmental impacts. Most of the data for the inventory (LCI) relies on the EcoInvent database.\n",

    "### 4.a) A bit of context\n",
    "Designing a product, such as a drone, involves making many decisions. For instance, propellers come in a range of sizes and materials. Similarly, batteries are available with different chemistries and capacities. Of course, some choices can be discarded as they won't satisfy the requirements. For example, a small battery won't keep a drone in the air for long. Still, there exist a quasi-infinite number of alternative solutions. With so many options, how do we choose the best design? This is where design optimization comes into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Design optimization aims to identify the most optimal design given a set of requirements (e.g., the drone should be able to lift a one kilogram package during 25 minutes). However, it is crucial to define what constitutes \"optimal\". Usually, the best design is defined as a balance between different factors, with economic considerations playing a pivotal role. For example, we might want a drone that's cheap to manufacture and/or to operate.\n",

Design optimization helps you figure out the ideal combination of these choices to meet your goals, whether it's maximizing performance, minimizing cost, or reducing environmental impact.\n",
