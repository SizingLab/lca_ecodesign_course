    "The first phase of an LCA study is to define the objective and the scope. This is a crucial step because it determines your results and how you interpret and review them. Specifically, the following elements need to be defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal**: What is the purpose of the study? Do you want to know the environmental impacts of an existing product/system? To compare different products? Or to guide the design of a product under development? You can also define who the study is for (R&D engineers? Customers? Decision makers inside or outside your organisation?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Product & Functional Unit**: What is the function of the product or system you are evaluating? For example, will you be evaluating an aircraft for fire fighting? Or for passenger transport (short/long haul)? This involves defining a functional unit, which is a quantification of the function and performance requirements. The functional unit must therefore reflect a quantity (e.g. move $x$ passengers over $y$ kilometres), a performance (e.g. for long distances) and a duration (e.g. for a period of 25 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Boundaries**: What is included in the study? What is outside the scope? In particular, it must be made clear if any phase of the life cycle is excluded. This will be very important when collecting data for the Life Cycle Inventory.\n",
    "  \n",

The weights applied to the normalised results are intended to reflect the relative importance of impacts according to specific value choices. Examples of weighting approaches include the representation of regulatory targets (e.g. CO2 reduction target), preferences of people, experts or organisations, geography (local versus global) or economic considerations.\n",
